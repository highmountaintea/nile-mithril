# Nile-mithril - Online Bookstore

This is an online bookstore written on mithril.js framework, based off [`nile-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nile-server). This bookstore app demonstrates all aspects of online shopping, such as user authentication, shopping history, inventory tracking, product search etc.

## Features

* true multi-user environment
* server persistence of transactions
* shopping cart persistence across sessions
* shopping history tracking
* product searching
* real-time inventory checking and warning

## Architecture

This app uses `route-based` architecture. Each route represents a page, and has its own state. This architecture reduces dependencies between different parts of the application, and prevents exponential complexity growth as the application becomes larger.

Some state has to be shared between pages, such as user login session. This information is stored as a singleton object in file `modelactions.js`. Leveraging the module system, this file can simply be imported and used by every component. This avoids the tedium of passing state objects down the hierarchy tree.
